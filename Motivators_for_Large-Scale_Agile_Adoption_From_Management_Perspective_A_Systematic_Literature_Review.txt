ABSTRACT The use of agile methods for software development has grown to a large extent in the last few
years. These methods ensure the quick delivery of software products with minimal cost and user satisfaction.
Though these techniques were initially developed for small developmental teams, certain challenges have
been observed when these methods are applied on large scale. However, we have conducted a systematic
literature review (SLR) for the identification of motivators for adopting agile methods on a large scale from
a management perspective. Thus, we have identified a total of 21 motivators for adopting agile methods
on a large scale from a management perspective. Among these motivators, some were marked as critical
motivators depending on variables, e.g., the factors critical in one variable might not be critical in another
variable. The factors which were recorded as critical in all variables are strong executive support, agile
development environment training and learning, agile development expertise, team competency, and briefing
of top management on agile. Furthermore, we also found that the impact of different motivators was different
depending on time and place for project manager guidance, i.e., some motivators were most critical in
one region while less critical in another. Similarly, some of the motivators were more critical in previous
decades but less critical in recent decades because of different improvements in software processes and
technologies. These motivators are also analyzed from different angles, i.e., decade-wise and region wise
for project managers guidance. The motivators are extracted from a sample of 58 research papers identified
via an SLR process. Finally, we have analyzed the identified motivators based on various variables, such as
continents and digital libraries.

While the research literature includes a bunch of expe-

from management perspectives, a summary of this growing
body of research is still missing in the form of SLR [25].

the gap with a hand out the outcome of SLR for LSAD team

In spite of the importance of ASDM in the background
of LSAD from management perspectives, no SLR has been
conducted on ASDM for large-scale development from man-

that have a remarkable impact on vendor organizations in

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Through SLR, we have identified different Motivators that
should be addressed and keep in view by project manager
when adopting software development for large scale develop-
ment team. In our study, the defined criteria for the criticality
of success are 30%, the Motivators which have percentage
greater than the defined percentage; it will be considered as

and continents for project manager guidance because some
Motivators were most critical in one region while less criti-

more critical in the previous decade but less critical presently
because of different improvements in software processes and
technologies.

There are 58 research papers selected through SLR for
conducting this research. In these research papers, maximum

faculty members of the universities. Most of these researchers
