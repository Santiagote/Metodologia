ABSTRACT In software engineering field, requirement change management is a challenging job. Ignoring
incoming changes results in customer displeasure. It may also result in late product transportation. Managing
requirement changes in poor way is the main cause of product failure. It has more diverse effect in global
software outsourcing. In software quality requirement change management, it is necessary to address success
factors in order to accomplish the requirements of the customers. In this paper, systematic literature review
approach is used for documentation and scrutinization of success factors. Total sixteen success factors were
recognized having great impact on quality software requirement change management. Our identified success
factors like ‘Proper Requirement Change Management’, ‘Rapid Delivery’, ‘Quality Software Product,
Access toMarket’, ‘Project Management’, ‘Skills andMethodologies’, ‘LowCost/Effort Estimation’, ‘Clear
Plan and Road Map’, ‘Agile Processes’, ‘Low Labor Cost’, ‘User Satisfaction’, ‘Communication/Close
Coordination’, ‘Proper Scheduling and Time Constraints’, ‘Frequent Technological Changes’, ‘Robust
Model’, ‘Geographical juncture/Cultural differences’ are the crucial factors that affect software quality
requirement change. Company size and different database have been used for the analysis of success factors.
The databases/search engine used are Google scholar, Science Direct, IEEE Explore and Springer for the
exploration of success factors. Companies are analyzed on the basis of their size such as small, medium and
large.

III. SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW
To identify success factors in software outsourcing qual-
ity requirement change management, we have taken help
from systematic literature review(SLR) [33]. So many other
researchers have also taken advantages from thismethod [34].
SLR is diverse from OLR in that it shadows systematic
protocol. Systematic literature review helps in collecting rel-
evant information with the help of systematic protocol having
search string along with research questions. The results of
SLR are measured more precise, trustworthy and less biased
when we compare it to OLR. This segment is used for
collecting data according to research questions. It is used
for identifying success factors having positive impact on
quality requirement change management process. two SLRs
have been used for identifying success factors, challenges
and practices. One is used for critical success factors and
critical challenges while the other for validation of practices.
We know that an SLR acts like a map for gathering and identi-
fying related data [35]. Stages of SLR are shown in Figure 5.
We have used Google scholar, Science Direct, IEEE, Explore
and Springer, because these databases and search engines
gave result matched to our title of our research article and
